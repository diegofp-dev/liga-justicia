# Ironman history from top to bottom

> Iron Man's origin story, as depicted in Marvel Comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU),
> centers around billionaire inventor Tony Stark. Captured by terrorists in Vietnam (or a similar
> conflict in comic iterations), he is forced to build a powerful weapon. Instead, he creates a suit of armor to escape,
> using it as a symbol of hope and later refining it to become Iron Man.
